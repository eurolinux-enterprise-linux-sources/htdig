How to use this:

--------------------------
Building htdig:

unzip the tarball

cd inside of the tarball root directory

./configure' with any parameters needed

---------------------------
Building libhtdig:

cd libhtdig

make

--------------------------
Building libhtdigphp:

cd libhtdigphp

./configure
make
./relink

Note: The relink script uses the PHP wrapper objects as well as all the object
in libhtdig to create a one-piece sharded library

---------------------------

note that the libhtdig_xxxx.cc take the place of the various utilities 'main'
functions.  Please look through them and compare to see if changes need to be
synced in.

---------------------------

This should make you a libhtdig.so.XXXX  Copy the latest libhtdig_api.h to a
place that you might need it.

link against libhtdig.so.XXXXX
