	<h2>
	  Introduction
	</h2>
	<p>
	  As any HTML author knows, information is only useful if it is
	  valid. Unfortunately, a lot of information has an inherent
	  expiration date. Things like meeting schedules, announcements
	  of upcoming events, and pages with those annoying yellow
	  'NEW' images by certain links.
	</p>
	<p>
	  <a href="index.html">ht://Dig</a> is a WWW index/search
	  system developed at <a href="http://www.sdsu.edu/">San Diego
	  State University</a>. Since this index system already scans
	  all HTML documents, it was the logical choice to incorporate
	  a reminder service into it.
	</p>
	<p>
	  ht://Dig can be told to remind you about an HTML page
	  sometime in the future. The reminder/notification will come
	  by email and will contain the URL to the page plus some other
	  information.
	</p>
	<hr>
	<h2>
	  Use
	</h2>
	<p>
	  ht://Dig detects special use of the &lt;META&gt; tag in HTML
	  documents. The &lt;META&gt; tags should go between
	  &lt;HEAD&gt; and &lt;/HEAD&gt; of an HTML document.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Example:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
	  &lt;HTML&gt;<br>
	  &lt;HEAD&gt;<br>
	  &lt;META NAME=&quot;htdig-email&quot;
	  CONTENT=&quot;pat.user@nowhere.net&quot;&gt;<br>
	  &lt;META NAME=&quot;htdig-email-subject&quot; CONTENT=&quot;Reminder to
	  update a page&quot;&gt;<br>
	  &lt;META NAME=&quot;htdig-notification-date&quot;
	  CONTENT=&quot;8/28/1995&quot;&gt;<br>
	  &lt;TITLE&gt;Someone's homepage.&lt;/TITLE&gt;<br>
	  &lt;/HEAD&gt;<br>
	  &lt;BODY&gt;<br>
	  <blockquote>
		<em>Body of document</em>
	  </blockquote>
	  &lt;/BODY&gt;<br>
	  &lt;/HTML&gt;
	</blockquote>
	<p>
	  After 8/28/1995 pat.user@nowhere.net will get a mail message
	  which will look something like this:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
	  <strong>From:</strong> ht://Dig email notification service<br>
	  <strong>Subject:</strong> WWW notification: Reminder to
	  update a page<br>
	  <strong>To:</strong> pat.user@nowhere.net<br>
	  <br>
	  The following page was tagged to notify you after 8/28/1995.<br>
	  <br>
	  URL: http://www.sdsu.edu/~turtle/index.html<br>
	  Date: 8/28/1995<br>
	  Subject: Reminder to update a page<br>
	</blockquote>
	<hr>
	<h2>
	  Attributes
	</h2>
	<p>
	  The special ht://Dig &lt;META&gt; tag attributes related to
	  notification are:
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>
		NAME=&quot;htdig-email&quot; CONTENT=&quot;<em>email address [, email
		address] ...</em>&quot;
	  </li>
	  <li>
		NAME=&quot;htdig-notification-date&quot; CONTENT=&quot;<em>earliest
		notification date</em>&quot;
	  </li>
	  <li>
		NAME=&quot;htdig-email-subject&quot; CONTENT=&quot;<em>notification message
		subject</em>&quot;
	  </li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	  Descriptions of the values for the attributes:
	</p>
	<dl>
	  <dt>
		<strong>htdig-email</strong>
	  </dt>
	  <dd>
		This is the email address the notification message should
		be sent to. Multiple email addresses can be given by
		separating them by commas. If no email address is given, no
		notification will be sent.
	  </dd>
	  <dt>
		<strong>htdig-notification-date</strong>
	  </dt>
	  <dd>
		This is the date on or after which the notification should
		be sent. The format is simply <em>month / day / year</em>,
		or if the <a href="attrs.html#iso_8601">iso_8601</a>
		attribute is set, <em>year - month - day</em>.
		Make sure that the year has the century with it as well.
		This means that you should use <em>1995</em> instead of
		<em>95</em>.<br>
		 The format of dates is actually a little more flexible than
		this. Any punctuation or white space can be used as separators,
		and if the year, month and date do not appear as expected in the
		order listed above, the notification service will try to make
		sense of the order used, if the date can be resolved unambiguously
		in another order. Using four-digit years avoids ambiguity between
		the year and the month or day. The format <em>year - month -
		day</em> is accepted without ambiguity when a four-digit year is
		used, whether the iso_8601 attribute is set or not.  When the
		year is given after the month and day, the format is either
		<em>day - month - year</em>, if iso_8601 is true and the year
		has four digits, or <em>month - day - year</em> otherwise.<br>
		 If no date is given, no notification will be sent. If a date is
		given but is malformed, a notification of this error will be sent.
		For correct dates, a notification will be sent every time the
		system runs the notification service, on or after the date given.
		To end the notifications, you must update or remove the
		notification date in the document.
	  </dd>
	  <dt>
		<strong>htdig-email-subject</strong>
	  </dt>
	  <dd>
		This specifies the subject the notification message. This
		is an optional attribute. Note that if you want to put
		spaces in the subject, you <strong>have</strong> to put
		double quotes (&quot;) around it.
	  </dd>
	</dl>
	<p>
	  There are a couple of other META attributes which are
	  recognized. These can be found in the more general
	  <a href="meta.html">ht://Dig META tag documentation</a>.
	</p>
	<hr>
	<h2>
	  Disclaimer
	</h2>
	<p>
	  This service is a free service for all HTML maintainers whose
	  documents are covered by the ht://Dig search system. If any
	  of the attributes are improperly formatted, no notifications
	  will be mailed. Email notification may not always occur on
	  the date that you specified. We can only guarantee a
	  notification of at most once a week.
