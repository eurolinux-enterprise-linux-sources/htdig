	This guide is intended for those upgrading from 3.1.x or
	earlier versions to 3.2.x. The best advice is
	<em>don't</em>. That is, it is highly recommended that you
	install the 3.2 release in a separate directory tree and treat
	everything as if you were installing it for the first
	time. This is not just because this is a beta release. There
	are several main reasons for this:
	<ul>
	<li>The htmerge program now <strong>only</strong> merges. You
	do not need to run it after running htdig as before. The
	&quot;cleanup&quot; duties have been moved to the <a
	href="htpurge.html">htpurge</a> program that also deletes
	URLs. The sample rundig script is modified accordingly.</li>
	<li>The default directory structure of this release is
	different from previous releases, more in line with other UNIX
	programs.</li>
	<li>The databases are all in different formats. This version
	cannot read databases from previous versions since the new
	formats have significantly more information and this cannot be
	reconstructed from old databases. This goes for fuzzy
	databases as well. Future versions can use the new <a
	href="htdump.html">htdump</a> and <a
	href="htload.html">htload</a> programs to dump and load
	databases to/from text files. These will also allow databases
	to be transfered between platforms.
	</li>
	</ul>
	Text files, such as config files, result templates, etc. are
	the same between releases, so you will probably wish to copy
	these to your new installation.</li>
	</p>

	<p>
	Additionally, you may find things a bit rough at first. We
	appreciate your comments and suggestions, especially in the
	form of performance comparisons with the 3.1.x
	releases. Additionally, there are several things planned for
	the final 3.2.0 release that have not been implemented yet:
	<ul>
	<li>Proximity (near) searching.</li>
	<li>Phrase searching method (in addition to and, or, and boolean).</li>
	<li>Field-based searching--restricting to a header, title, etc.</li>
	<li>Date-based searching--restricting to a range of dates.</li>
	<li>Implementation of a more accurate scoring system.</li>
	<li>Parallel indexing and searching.</li>
	<li>Support for https: and ftp: access</li>
	</ul>
	Please send comments, patches, etc. to the &lt;<a
	href="mailto:htdig3-dev@htdig.org">htdig3-dev@htdig.org</a>&gt;
	mailing list.
