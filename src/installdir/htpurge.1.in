htpurge \-  remove unused odocuments from the database (general maintenance script)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B htpurge
.I "[-][-a][-c configfile][-u][-v]"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Htpurge functions to remove specified URLs from the databases as well as bad URLs, 
unretrieved URLs, obsolete documents, etc. It is recommended that htpurge be run 
after htdig to clean out any documents of this sort. 
.TP
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-
Take \fIURL\fR list from standard input (rather than specified with \fI-u\fR). Format of input file is one URL per line.
.B \-a
Use alternate work files. Tells htpurge to append
.I .work
to database files, causing a second copy of the database to be
built. This allows the original files to be used by htsearch
during the run. 
.TP
.B \-c \fIconfigfile\fR
Use the specified
.I configfile
instead of the default. 
.TP
.B \-u \fIURL\fR
Add this \fIURL\fR to the list of documents to remove. Must be specified multiple times if
more than one \fIURL\fR are to be removed. Should nor be used together with \fI-\fR.
.TP
.B \-v
Verbose mode. This increases the verbosity of the program.
Using more than 2 is probably only useful for debugging
purposes. The default verbose mode (using only one \fI\-v\fR) gives
a nice progress report while digging. 
.SH "FILES"
.TP
.B @DEFAULT_CONFIG_FILE@
The default configuration file.
