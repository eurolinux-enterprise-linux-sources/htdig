# First we declare the character set.  Since it's English, it's easy.
# The only special character is the apostrophe, so that possessives can
# be handled.  We declare it as a boundary character, so that quoting with
# single quotes doesn't confuse things.  The apostrophe is the only
# character that gets such treatment.
#
# We declare the apostrophe first so that "Jon's" collates before "Jonas".
# (This is the way ASCII does it).

# Now the prefix table.  There are only three prefixes that are truly
# frequent in English, and none of them seem to need conditional variations.

prefixes

flag *A:
    .		>	RE		# As in enter > reenter

flag *I:
    .		>	IN		# As in disposed > indisposed

flag *U:
    .		>	UN		# As in natural > unnatural

# Finally, the suffixes.  These are exactly the suffixes that came out
# with the original "ispell";  I haven't tried to improve them.  The only
# thing I did besides translate them was to add selected cross-product flags.
