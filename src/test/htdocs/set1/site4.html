Fluctuations in interest rate are reflected in the length of the
repayment term, not in the monthly payment amount, unless an increase
in monthly amount is needed to keep the payment period within the
program maximum. Citibank offers three repayment options:

<UL>
<LI>Pay interest-only during the in-school and 6 month grace period. 
<LI>Pay 15 years of principal and interest, capitalizing the interest during the in-school period.

years to repay the loan depending on the amount borrowed (15 years for
a $10,000 loan). <P>

The GradEXCEL, LawEXCEL, MBA-EXCEL, and MedDent-EXCEL Education Loan
Programs lets graduate and professional students borrow from $2,000 to
$10,000 a year (up to $12,000 for law students) on their own, or up to
the cost of attendance with a cosigner. Medical and Dental students
have the option to borrow an additional $5,000 in the final year of
medical or dental school for use during residency interviews or
relocation expenses. Repayment options include defering principal and
interest until six months after leaving school (MedDent-EXCEL
borrowers can continue to defer principal during residency or
internship, but must pay interest), making monthly payments of
interest only while the student is in school, or making monthly
payments of principal and interest while the student is in school. You
can take up to 20 years to repay the loan depending on the amount
borrowed. <P>

Interest rates are the same for all loans and are pegged to the Prime
rate. You can choose either a monthly variable rate of Prime plus 0.5%
during the first year and Prime plus 1.0% during subsequent years, or
a one-year renewable rate of Prime plus 2-3%. <P>

There are no origination fees. EXCEL Loans have a 7% guarantee
fee. With a cosigner, the GradEXCEL, LawEXCEL, MBA-EXCEL, and
MedDent-EXCEL loans have a 7% guarantee fee. Without a cosigner, the
guarantee fees are 9% for MBA and medical students and 10% for
graduate, law, and dental students. <P>

Sallie Mae is the nation's largest secondary market and holds
approximately one third of all educational loans. Sallie Mae buys
student loans from lenders and administers them from origination
through repayment. Sallie Mae is affiliated with several lenders
(currently Norwest Bank and Household Bank fsb) who offer private loan
programs. <P>

The private loan programs include: 

<UL>
<LI>LAWLOANS: Law Student Loans and Bar Study Loans 
<LI>MEDLOANS: Alternative Loan Program (for allopathic medical students) and MEDEX (for residency interviews and relocation) 
<LI>MBALOANS: Tuition Loan Program (for students attending approved business schools) and Executive MBA Loan (for students enrolled in non-traditional MBA programs) 
</UL>

Borrowers under these loan programs may be required to apply for
federal student aid first. Eligibility is restricted to US citizens,
nationals, and permanent residents. The LAWLOANS and MBALOANS require
permanent residents to have a US citizen as cosigner. The MBALOANS
requires international students to have creditworthy cosigners and to
make interest payments during the in-school period. <P>

All loans have let you borrow a minimum of $1,000 ($500 for continuing
borrowers). Each program has a different maximum loan amount. The
LAWLOANS maximum is $60,000 without a cosigner, $100,000 with a
cosigner. The Bar Study Loan lets you borrow up to $7,500. The
MEDLOANS lets you borrow up to $20,000 per year. The MEDEX loan lets
you borrow up to $7,000. In addition, the LAWLOANS has an aggregate
maximum for all educational loans of $102,500 without a cosigner,
$150,000 with a cosigner. For MEDLOANS the aggregate maximum is
$142,500. <P>

The interest rates are based on the 91-day T-bill rates, plus a
spread, and vary quarterly. For LAWLOANS the interest rate for FFELP
borrowers is T-bill plus 3.25% during the in-school period and for
FDSLP it is T-bill plus 3.50%. During repayment the rate for both is
T-bill plus 3.50%. For MEDLOANS it is T-bill plus 2.5% during the
in-school period, and T-bill plus 2.85% during repayment. For MBALOANS
the rate for FFELP borrowers is T-bill plus 3.25% during the in-school
period, T-bill plus 3.40% during repayment, and T-bill plus 3.50% for
FDSLP borrowers. Interest is capitalized at the beginning of
repayment, except for MEDLOANS where the interest is capitalized upon
leaving medical school and annually until repayment begins. <P>

Loan fees for LAWLOANS are 7.5% at disbursement, plus an additional
4.25% at repayment if there is no cosigner. Loan fees for MEDLOANS are
7% at disbursement, plus 2% of principal and accrued interest at the
beginning of repayment. The MEDEX loan has an additional origination
fee of 1.5%. Loan fees for MBALOANS are 7.5% at disbursement, plus an
additional 2.5% at repayment if there is no cosigner. <P>

The minimum payment for all loans is $50. The loan term for LAWLOANS
is up to 15 years and begins following a 9 month grace period after
leaving school or 4 years after disbursement, whichever comes
first. The loan term for MEDLOANS is up to 20 years, and begins 3-4
years after graduation (depending on length of the residency program)
or 9 months after withdrawal. MEDLOANS offers a repayment option of 3
years of interest-only payments and 17 years of interest and principal
payments. The loan term for MBALOANS is 12-15 years, depending on the
loan balance, and begins 6 months after leaving school or 3 years
after disbursement, whichever comes first. The MBALOANS offers level
or graduated repayment options. <P>

Borrowers of these private loans get access to Sallie Mae discounts,
including a 0.25% interest rate reduction for authorizing an automatic
monthly deduction of the education loan payments from your check or
savings account (Direct Repay) and a 0.5% interest rate reduction for
Law Student or Bar Study loan borrowers who make their first 48
scheduled monthly payments on time (Law Rewards). <P>

<A HREF="http://www.teri.org/alt.htm"><B>TERI Alternative Loan
Program</B></A><BR>

The TERI Alternative Loan Program program provides loans for graduate
students who are enrolled at least half-time in a degree-granting
program at a TERI-approved school. Approval is based on
creditworthiness, not financial need. This program lets you borrow
from $2,000 up to the cost of education, less any financial aid
received. You can borrow to cover past due balances owed to the school
from a prior loan period. <P>

Repayment begins 45 days after disbursement. There is an alternate
deferred repayment option in which payments are interest-only while
the student is in school (for up to four consecutive years), with
repayment of interest and principal beginning 45 days after graduation
or withdrawal from school. There is a $50 minimum payment. The term of
the loan is for up to 25 years, depending on the amount borrowed, and
there is no penalty for prepayment. <P>

There is a 5% guarantee fee. The interest rate depends on the lender,
and is variable, ranging from a low of Prime plus 0% (Bank of Boston,
Household Bank, and PNC Bank) to a high of Prime plus 2%
(Citibank). First Union National Bank offers the loan at Prime +
1.25%. On the variable interest rate loans, any fluctuation in the
interest rate will be reflected in the length of repayment, not in the
size of the monthly payment, unless an increase in the monthly amount
is needed to keep the repayment period within the 25 year maximum. <P>

The Maine Education Loan Authority offers the MELA loan for Maine
students and Maine residents. There is a $50 application fee, and the
loan is offered with either a fixed interest rate or a variable
interest rate based on the 91-day T-Bill rate plus a spread determined
by the lender. <P>

<A HREF="http://www.teri.org"><B>TERI Professional Education Program
(PEP)</B></A><BR>

The TERI PEP program provides loans for graduate and professional
study. It lets graduate and professional students borrow up to $7,500
($12,000 for law students) annually on their own credit. If the
borrower is creditworthy or has a creditworthy cosigner, the TERI PEP
program lets the student borrow annually up to the cost of education
less any financial aid received or $20,000, whichever is less, with a
cumulative limit of $80,000. <P>

There are aggregate borrowing limits depending on the
profession. These aggregate limits include all education debt,
undergraduate and graduate. Graduate students who are creditworthy or
who apply with a creditworthy cosigner are not subject to these
limits. The aggregate limits are:

<UL> 

<LI> $90,000 -- Medicine (MD degree) 
<LI> $90,000 -- Osteopathic Medicine
<LI> $77,000 -- Law

<LI> $44,000 -- Engineering
<LI> $44,000 -- Physical Sciences
<LI> $33,000 -- All other graduate/professional programs.

</UL>

The student makes no payments for up to 4.5 consecutive years while
still in school. Unpaid interest is capitalized at repayment. Medical
school students may request a second deferment on the new principal
balance after the interest has been capitalized, for up to 4 years
while completing a medical internship or residency (with
capitalization at repayment). <P>

There is a $50 minimum monthly payment and the term of the loan is for
up to 20 years. Fluctuations in the interest rate will be reflected in
the length of repayment, not in the size of the monthly payment,
unless an increase in the monthly amount is needed to keep the
repayment period within the 20 year maximum. <P>

A guarantee fee is deducted at origination. The guarantee fee is 6%
with a cosigner, 9% without. The interest rate is variable, and
depends on the lender. The Bank of Boston, Household Bank, and PNC
Bank offer the TERI PEP loans at an interest rate of Prime + 0%. The
Bank of Boston charges a origination fee of 0.5%, with a $50
cap. First Union National Bank offers TERI PEP loans at Prime +
1.25%. Citibank offers the Citibank PEP loan at Prime + 2%. <P>
