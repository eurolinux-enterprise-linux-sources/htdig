# access.conf: Global access configuration
# Online docs at http://www.apache.org/

# This file defines server settings which affect which types of services
# are allowed, and in what circumstances. 

# Each directory to which Apache has access, can be configured with respect
# to which services and features are allowed and/or disabled in that
# directory (and its subdirectories). 

# Originally by Rob McCool

# /usr/local/etc/httpd/ should be changed to whatever you set ServerRoot to.
<Directory _TESTDIR_/cgi-bin>
Options Indexes FollowSymLinks ExecCGI
</Directory>

#<Directory _TESTDIR_/htdocs/cookies>
#Options Indexes FollowSymLinks ExecCGI
#CookieTracking on
#</Directory>

# This should be changed to whatever you set DocumentRoot to.

<Directory _TESTDIR_/htdocs>

# This may also be "None", "All", or any combination of "Indexes",
# "Includes", "FollowSymLinks", "ExecCGI", or "MultiViews".

# Note that "MultiViews" must be named *explicitly* --- "Options All"
# doesn't give it to you (or at least, not yet).

Options Indexes FollowSymLinks ExecCGI

# This option allows you to turn on the XBitHack behavior, which allows you
# to make text/html server-parsed by activating the owner x bit with chmod. 
# This directive may be used wherever Options may, and has three
# possible arguments: Off, On or Full. If set to full, Apache will also
# add a Last-Modified header to the document if the group x bit is set.

# Unless the server has been compiled with -DXBITHACK, this function is
# off by default. To use, uncomment the following line:

#XBitHack Full

# This controls which options the .htaccess files in directories can
# override. Can also be "None", or any combination of "Options", "FileInfo", 
# "AuthConfig", and "Limit"

AllowOverride All

# Controls who can get stuff from this server.

<Limit GET>
order allow,deny
allow from all
</Limit>

</Directory>

# You may place any other directories you wish to have access
# information for after this one.
