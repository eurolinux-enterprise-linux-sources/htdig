SHOWSTOPPERS:

KNOWN BUGS:
(none serious.
See <http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=104593&group_id=4593&func=browse>.)

PENDING PATCHES (available but need work):
* Gilles's configuration parsing patches need testing before committing.
* Memory improvements to htmerge. (Backed out b/c htword API changed.)
* Mifluz merge.  (Is this still pending??)

NEEDED FEATURES:
* Quim's new htsearch/qtest query parser framework.
* File/Database locking. PR#405764.

TESTING:
* httools programs: 
  (htload a test file, check a few characteristics, htdump and compare)
* Tests for new config file parser
* Duplicate document detection while indexing
* Major revisions to ExternalParser.cc, including fork/exec instead of popen,
  argument handling for parser/converter, allowing binary output from an
  external converter.
* ExternalTransport needs testing of changes similar to ExternalParser.

DOCUMENTATION:
* List of supported platforms/compilers is ancient. (PR#405279)
* Document all of htsearch's mappings of input parameters to config attributes
   to template variables. (Relates to PR#405278.)
  Should we make sure these config attributes are all documented in
  defaults.cc, even if they're only set by input parameters and never
  in the config file?
* Split attrs.html into categories for faster loading.
* Turn defaults.cc into an XML file for generating documentation and 
  defaults.cc.
* require.html is not updated to list new features and disk space
   requirements of 3.2.x (e.g. regex matching, database compression.)
   PRs# 405280 #405281.
* Htfuzzy could use more documentation on what each fuzzy algorithm
   does. PR#405714.
* Document the list of all installed files and default
   locations. PR#405715.

OTHER ISSUES:
* Can htsearch actually search while an index is being created?
* The code needs a security audit, esp. htsearch. PR#405765.
